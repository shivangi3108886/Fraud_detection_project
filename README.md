# Fraud_detection_project
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques.  
It applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and classification models to identify fraud patterns.

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

## Workflow
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Model Training & Evaluation
4. Comparison of Algorithms

## Results
- Achieved 99% accuracy with Random Forest
- ROC-AUC score: 0.92
